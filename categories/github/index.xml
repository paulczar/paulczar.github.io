      <description>After what seems like an eternity I finally got added to the GitHub Actions beta a few days ago.
I recently created a Hugo website for learning Kubernetes called k8s.camp which is hosted in GitHub Pages and I figured that switching it from CircleCI to GitHub Actions would be a great way to learn Actions.
Before I get started I do want to mention that my experience as a new user trying to learn how actions work was sub-optimal.</description>

      <title>Creating a Github Pages Blog With Octopress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of tech bloggers will write their blog posts in &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, convert it to HTML and paste that HTML into their blog of choice and then in the blog&amp;rsquo;s editor clean it up to suit their blog.   This is an excellent way to create easy to read portable documents that can easily be published in multiple formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However what if there was a way to skip the second part of that and just create a markdown page, submit it into your source control ( you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use source control right? ) and your blog would automagically update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
