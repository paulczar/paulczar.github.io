      <title>Building Spring Docker Images</title>

      <description>While investigating running Spring applications on Kubernetes I discovered that a lot of the existing example Spring applications do not have a Dockerfile in their git repository. I thought this odd at first (and frankly still do).
What I discovered though, is there&amp;rsquo;s quite a number of ways to build Spring (and Java in general) container images that don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily rely on writing a Dockerfile.
Full disclosure, I am a firm believe that any opensource project of consequence (where feasible) should ship a Dockerfile in their git repo, and ideally have images up on the Docker hub (or other public container registry) as it allows for newcomers to experience your application or project in just a few seconds with no need to play detective to try and figure out how to get it running.</description>

      <title>Flexible Private Docker Registry Infrastructure</title>

      <description>Previously I showed how to run a basic secure Docker Registry. I am now going to expand on this to show you something that you might use in production as part of your CI/CD infrastructure.
The beauty of running Docker is that you can push an image from a developer&amp;rsquo;s laptop all the way into production which helps ensure that what you see in development and your various test/qa/stage environments are exactly the same as what you run in production.</description>

      <description>There comes a time in everybody&amp;rsquo;s life where they realize they have to run their own Docker Registry. Unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of good information on how to run one. Docker&amp;rsquo;s documentation is pretty good, but is verbose and across a lot of different pages which means having half a dozen tabs open and searching for the right information.
While it&amp;rsquo;s pretty common to run the Docker Registry itself with little to no security settings and fronting it with NGINX or Apache to provide this security I wanted to show how it can be done with just the Docker Registry.</description>

      <title>Securing Docker with TLS certificates</title>

      <description>By default Docker (and by extension Docker Swarm) has no authentication or authorization on its API, relying instead on the filesystem security of its unix socket /var/run/docker.sock which by default is only accessible by the root user.
This is fine for the basic use case of the default behavior of only accessing the Docker API on the local machine via the socket as the root user. However if you wish to use the Docker API over TCP then you&amp;rsquo;ll want to secure it so that you don&amp;rsquo;t give out root access to anyone that happens to poke you on the TCP port.</description>

      <description>Given Docker&amp;rsquo;s propensity for creating easy to use tools it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise that Docker Swarm is one of the easier to understand and run of the &amp;ldquo;Docker Clustering&amp;rdquo; options currently out there. I recently built some Terraform configs for deploying a Highly Available Docker Swarm cluster on Openstack and learned a fair bit about Swarm in the process.
This guide is meant to be a platform agnostic howto on installing and running a Highly Available Docker Swarm to show you the ideas and concepts that may not be as easy to understand from just reading some config management code.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-some-values-of-right&#34;&gt;For some values of &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost since &lt;a href=&#34;http://docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced to the world there has been a fairly strong push to keeping containers to be single process.   This makes a lot of sense and definitely plays into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://12factor.net&#34;&gt;12 Factor&lt;/a&gt; way of thinking where all application output should be pushed to &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; and docker itself with tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/progrium/logspout&#34;&gt;logspout&lt;/a&gt; now has fairly strong tooling to deal with those logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes however it just makes sense to run more than one process in a container,  a perfect example would be running &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd&#34;&gt;confd&lt;/a&gt; as well as your application in order to modify the application&amp;rsquo;s config file based on changes in service discovery systems like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/coreos/etcd&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt;.   The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/articles/ambassador_pattern_linking/&#34;&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; container way of working can achieve similar things, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that running two containers with a process each to run your application is any better than running one container with two processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EZ Bake&lt;/code&gt; came from an idea I had while watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hangops&#34;&gt;HangOps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clLFKIeSADo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;episode 2014-04-11&lt;/a&gt; in which they were talking about &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; and Config Management being complementary rather than adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have expermented with using &lt;code&gt;Chef&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; together in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.paulcz.net/2013/09/creating-immutable-servers-with-chef-and-docker-dot-io.html&#34;&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; but wanted to tackle the problem from a slightly different angle.  I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on some PAAS stuff, both &lt;a href=&#34;http://deis.io&#34;&gt;Deis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://solum.io&#34;&gt;Solum&lt;/a&gt; these both utilize the tooling from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flynn/flynn&#34;&gt;Flynn&lt;/a&gt; which builds heroku style &lt;code&gt;buildpacks&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Building out DEIS is quite easy,  make more easy by some tight integration they have with Rackspace Cloud.

      <title>Managing docker services with this one easy trick</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been having a lot of internal debate about the idea of running more than one service in a docker container.   A Docker container is built to run a single process in the foreground and to live for only as long as that process is running.  This is great in a utopian world where servers are immutable and sysadmins drink tiki drinks on the beach,  however it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always translate well to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples where you might want to be able to run multiple servers span from the simple use case of running &lt;code&gt;sshd&lt;/code&gt; as well as your application to running a web app such as &lt;code&gt;wordpress&lt;/code&gt; where you might want both &lt;code&gt;apache&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; running in the same container.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building applications in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docker.io&#34;&gt;docker.io&lt;/a&gt; Dockerfile is relatively simple,  but sometimes you want to just install the application exactly as you would normally via already built chef cookbooks.   Turns out this is actually pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll need to do is build a container with chef-client and berkshelf installed.   You can grab the one I&amp;rsquo;ve built by running &lt;code&gt;docker pull paulczar/chef-solo&lt;/code&gt; or build one youself from a &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; that looks a little something like the following&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
