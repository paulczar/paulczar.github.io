      <description>Habitat is a project from Chef that provides you a reasonably simple way to build, package, and configure your application.
 &amp;ldquo;Habitat is an integrated solution to building, running, and maintaining your application throughout its lifetime. It builds your application and its services into immutable artifacts with declarative dependencies, and then provides automatic rebuilds of your application and its services as your application code and dependencies have upstream updates.&amp;rdquo; - Habitat Getting Started Guide.</description>
