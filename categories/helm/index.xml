      <description>I recently found myself writing instructions on how to deploy an application to several Kubernetes platform and ended up writing a different Kubernetes manifests for each platform. 95% of the content was the same with just a few different directives based on how the particular platform handles ingress, or if we needed a Registry secret or a TLS certificate.
Kubernetes manifests are very declarative and don&amp;rsquo;t offer any way to put conditionals or variables that could be set in them.</description>
