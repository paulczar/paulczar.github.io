      <description>I recently had the privilege to help organize DevOpsDays Texas 2021, a virtual event that we ran to try and scratch our DevOpsDays itch given that in-person conferences won&amp;rsquo;t be happening any time soon.&#xA;To see the replays of the event you can watch the Day 1 and Day 2 streams over on youtube.&#xA;I had the dubious honor of being the most experienced at the technical setup for live streaming and therefore was nominated as the person to figure out how to live stream the event to Youtube.</description>
