      <description>I recently had the privilege to help organize DevOpsDays Texas 2021 a virtual event that we ran to try and scratch our DevOpsDays itch given that in-person conferences won&amp;rsquo;t be happening any time soon.
To see the final product you can watch the Day 1 and Day 2 streams over on youtube.
I had the misfortune of being the most experienced at OBS setup for live streaming and therefore was nominated as the person to figure out how to live stream the event to Youtube.</description>
