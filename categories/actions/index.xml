      <description>After what seems like an eternity I finally got added to the GitHub Actions beta a few days ago.
I recently created a Hugo website for learning Kubernetes called k8s.camp which is hosted in GitHub Pages and I figured that switching it from CircleCI to GitHub Actions would be a great way to learn Actions.
Before I get started I do want to mention that my experience as a new user trying to learn how actions work was sub-optimal.</description>
