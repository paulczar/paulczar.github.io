      <description>&amp;ldquo;See how this sparkly devop princess bakes bread every day with almost no effort at all with this one weird trick&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Store bought bread is shit. Even the &amp;ldquo;artisanal&amp;rdquo; bread at most supermarkets is little better than cake baked in a bread shaped mold ( seriously check next time you&amp;rsquo;re at a supermarket ). You might be lucky and have a really good bread baker near you, but like butchers and other important crafts they have all but disappeared.</description>
