      <description>Introduction Welcome to a three part blog series on Creating a Helm Chart Repository. In part 1 I will demonstrate creating a Helm chart repository using GitHub nd GitHub ages. In part 2 I will add Automation to automatically update the repository, and in part 3 I will add testing for changes to the charts themselves.
Helm is the defacto tool for packaging, sharing, and running Kubernetes Manifests. I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you know the basics of Helm and have used it before.</description>

In part 1 of this series I demonstrated creating a Helm chart repository using GitHuband GitHubPages. In this part 2 I will add Automation to automatically update the repository, and in part 2 I will add testing for changes to the charts themselves.
Use Circle CI to automate Helm Chart Updates  Note: While I would usually use Concourse CI for my CI workflows, I wanted to only use managed services and I chose Circle as that is already commonly used in the Helm community.</description>

      <title>Cloud Native Operations - Kubernetes Controllers</title>
      <link>https://tech.paulcz.net/blog/cloud-native-operations-k8s-controllers/</link>

      <description>Lulz what? Cloud Native Operations ?!?!?! Historically Operations practices have lagged behind development. During the 90s a number of lightweight software development practices evolved such as Scrum and Extreme Programming. During the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s it became pretty common to practice (or at least claim to) some form of Agile in software development.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the last year of that decade that we started to see an uptick in Operations folks wanting to adopt Agile type methodologies and as the devops (and later SRE) movements took off we started to borrow heavily from Lean principals such as Kanban and Value Stream Mapping.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-some-values-of-right&#34;&gt;For some values of &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost since &lt;a href=&#34;http://docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced to the world there has been a fairly strong push to keeping containers to be single process.   This makes a lot of sense and definitely plays into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://12factor.net&#34;&gt;12 Factor&lt;/a&gt; way of thinking where all application output should be pushed to &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; and docker itself with tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/progrium/logspout&#34;&gt;logspout&lt;/a&gt; now has fairly strong tooling to deal with those logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes however it just makes sense to run more than one process in a container,  a perfect example would be running &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd&#34;&gt;confd&lt;/a&gt; as well as your application in order to modify the application&amp;rsquo;s config file based on changes in service discovery systems like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/coreos/etcd&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt;.   The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/articles/ambassador_pattern_linking/&#34;&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; container way of working can achieve similar things, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that running two containers with a process each to run your application is any better than running one container with two processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;See how this sparkly devop princess bakes bread every day with almost no effort at all with this one weird trick&amp;rdquo;
Store bought bread is shit. Even the &amp;ldquo;artisanal&amp;rdquo; bread at most supermarkets is little better than cake baked in a bread shaped mold ( seriously check next time you&amp;rsquo;re at a supermarket ). You might be lucky and have a really good bread baker near you, but like butchers and other important crafts they have all but disappeared.</description>

      <title>EZBake - A new way to converge docker containers with chef</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EZ Bake&lt;/code&gt; came from an idea I had while watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hangops&#34;&gt;HangOps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clLFKIeSADo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;episode 2014-04-11&lt;/a&gt; in which they were talking about &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; and Config Management being complementary rather than adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have expermented with using &lt;code&gt;Chef&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; together in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.paulcz.net/2013/09/creating-immutable-servers-with-chef-and-docker-dot-io.html&#34;&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; but wanted to tackle the problem from a slightly different angle.  I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on some PAAS stuff, both &lt;a href=&#34;http://deis.io&#34;&gt;Deis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://solum.io&#34;&gt;Solum&lt;/a&gt; these both utilize the tooling from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flynn/flynn&#34;&gt;Flynn&lt;/a&gt; which builds heroku style &lt;code&gt;buildpacks&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-austin/&#34;&gt;DevOps Days Austin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mattray&#34;&gt;@mattray&lt;/a&gt; did an Openspace session on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby&#34;&gt;Omnibus&lt;/a&gt; which is a toolset based around the concept of installing an app and all of it&amp;rsquo;s prerequisites from source into a directory and then building a package ( either .deb or .rpm ) of that using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm&#34;&gt;fpm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having battled many times with OS Packages trying to get newer versions of Ruby, or Redis or other software installed and having to hunt down some random package repo or manually build from source this seems like an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn the basics I decided to build an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/paulczar/omnibus-fpm&#34;&gt;omnibus package for fpm&lt;/a&gt; which helped me work out the kinks and learn the basics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of prototyping with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#34;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt;, specifically for a couple of distinct activities:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building puppet modules using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/elasticdog/puppet-sandbox&#34;&gt;the excellent puppet sandbox&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and building RPM packages with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm&#34;&gt;FPM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized I was spending a bunch of time flipping back and forth between Vagrant environments and I had no quick way to utilize RPMs built with FPM inside my puppet modules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
