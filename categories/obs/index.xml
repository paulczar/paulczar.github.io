      <description>I recently had the privilege to help organize DevOpsDays Texas 2021 a virtual event that we ran to try and scratch our DevOpsDays itch given that in-person conferences won&amp;rsquo;t be happening any time soon.

I chose to use Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to manage the stream and Windows as the OS to run it on (OBS support is generally best on windows).</description>
