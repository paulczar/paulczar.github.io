      <description>Introduction Welcome to the first part in a series of blog posts looking at running Spring applications on Kubernetes. To kick the series off we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at the Spring Pet Clinic example application and demonstrate how we can quickly and easily get it running on Kubernetes.
