      <title>Building Spring Docker Images</title>

      <description>While investigating running Spring applications on Kubernetes I discovered that a lot of the existing example Spring applications do not have a Dockerfile in their git repository. I thought this odd at first (and frankly still do).
What I discovered though, is there&amp;rsquo;s quite a number of ways to build Spring (and Java in general) container images that don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily rely on writing a Dockerfile.
Full disclosure, I am a firm believe that any opensource project of consequence (where feasible) should ship a Dockerfile in their git repo, and ideally have images up on the Docker hub (or other public container registry) as it allows for newcomers to experience your application or project in just a few seconds with no need to play detective to try and figure out how to get it running.</description>

      <title>Spring into Kubernetes - Part 1</title>

      <description>Introduction Welcome to the first part in a series of blog posts looking at running Spring applications on Kubernetes. To kick the series off we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at the Spring Pet Clinic example application and demonstrate how we can quickly and easily get it running on Kubernetes.
Step 1. Install a Kubernetes Before we get started I would encourage you to read (or at least skim) through Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s seminal Kubernetes The Hard Way to get an idea for the complexity of installing and operating a Kubernetes cluster.</description>
